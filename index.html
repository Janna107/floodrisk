    <p>As FEMA prepares to release new flood hazard zones and mandatory flood insurance maps in 2024, disparities in flood insurance coverage are more visible than ever before.</p>

    <p> Events like this Monday’s coastal storm and the September flooding made these vulnerabilities even more apparent in New York City, echoing recent flood events like Hurricanes Ida and Sandy.</p>

    <p>The Bronx has significantly less flood coverage than any other borough in NYC.</p>

    <p> Climate change isn’t just a threat to our land and our health; it’s a threat to our wallets.
    But flood damage is not covered by most renters and homeowners policies.</p>

    <p> What’s maybe more surprising: the most popular flood insurance provider in the United States is the government.</p>

    <p> Flood insurance can be purchased through a company underwritten by FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program, which offers flood insurance to homeowners, renters and business owners. Anyone can buy flood insurance through FEMA as long as their community participates in the national program.</p>

    <p>“I think for your average person who wants protection against a flood disaster, NFIP is a really good first stop,” said Andrew Rumbach, Senior Fellow at the Urban Institute. “Especially if you're intimidated by those other options and all the different exclusions.”</p>

    <p>While the NFIP rating system tries to ensure consistent pricing across NFIP underwritten policies, experts say this doesn’t always play out in reality due to inconsistencies from companies and agents.

    <p> Experts recommend checking with multiple companies, at least three, in order to ensure you are getting the best price for your flood risk.</p>

    <p>You can find a list of insurance companies underwritten by the NFIP <a href="https://www.floodsmart.gov/flood-insurance-provider">here.</a></p>
